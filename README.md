# An Animator's Dozen

An online animated short film festival! This project is a prototype of a monthly animated film festival where 13 curated short films are on exhibition from the comfort of your own home. There is a Q&A section for asking filmmaker questions and you can even submit your animated short film for consideration for the next month's showcase. 

## Motivation 

This was a portfolio project created for Flatiron School. I wanted to learn how to build a simple streaming platform with JavaScript React/Redux while using a Ruby on Rails backend API. 

## Installation

After forking and cloning the repository, 

IN backend directory:

install bundler: ```$ bundle```  

Run ```$rails db:create```, then ```$ rails db:migrate```, and then ```$rails db:seed``` (if commented out, uncomment before seeding). 


## Usage

In your terminal run ```$ rails s``` in the backend directory and start your local server.
In your terminal run ```$ npm start``` in the frontend directory and start the 2nd local server. (install npm or any necessary npm packages if you run into any errors)

Run the application in the 2nd local server. 

Have fun with An Animtator's Dozen! Watch the movies! Add movies! Find your own collection of animated short films!  


## Roadmap

For future releases, I would like to add user authentication. Since this is a demo of an online film festival, I might rebuild the application with more features and user interactivity. As someone who has worked film festivals, I would also like to get the input of colleagues on how to make the best website for an online film festival.
