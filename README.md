# An Animator's Dozen

An online animated short film festival! This project is a prototype of a monthly animated film festival where 13 curated short films are on exhibition from the comfort of your own home. There is a Q&A section for asking filmmaker questions and you can even submit your animated short film for consideration for the next month.
